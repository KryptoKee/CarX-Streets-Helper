# CarX Streets Helper

This is a tool to modify in-game values (XP, Cash, Gold) in CarX Streets.

# Tutorial

Go to Releases page and grab the EXE, run it and click connect with CarX running.

Current values will be shown on the Helper, enter a new one and click set to change them. Refresh will recheck and show accurate info at any time.

To gain Cash and Gold set the new value then if it has not changed, spend any amount of that currency to force the update. If they ever show as 0, or 1, restarting your game will correct it to the value you set.

To gain XP simply do a small drift or speed to gain any amount of XP, it will change to the value you set un updating.

Enjoy
